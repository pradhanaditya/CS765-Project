## Points to Note

- `Node == Peer == Miner` all three mean the same
- `txn == transaction`
- `Unit of time = seconds` for everything
- `md5` hash function is used for speed - Can be updated to use any other hash function
- `GenesisBlock.prev_node_hash = -1`
- `if` a block with `block_index < node.curr_block_index_max` is received, then it is _not dropped_ because:
  1. The received block can become ancestor of a block which forms a longer chain in future
  2. The block creator would not spend their time and computation power in creating and sending a block which does not
     create a longest chain
- `Transactions` created are always assumed to be authentic in this simulation
  - In the real world, they are signed by the transaction creators (i.e. money senders)
- `mining reward` is always the first transaction of any block, and sender is `-1` only
  - `Sender == -1` means money is created from thin air
  - If mining reward transaction is placed at any position other than index 0, then it is invalid
  - If id_sender for mining reward transaction is anything other than `-1`, then it is invalid
- `mining_reward_update_percent` is used as follows: `new_reward = old_reward (1 + mining_reward_update_percent / 100)`
  - The above statement will be executed every `mining_reward_update_block_time` blocks
    - i.e. when `longest_chain.index % mining_reward_update_block_time == 0`
- Empty blocks are valid
  - Sometimes bitcoin and ethereum have empty blocks
- Any valid transaction created should enter the blockchain even if forks happen
  - We find the common ansestor between the tails of the fork with the help of `block index`
- `Simple Cache` is implemented to optimize block validation and creation
- It is assumed that no one will create time pass transactions where sender and receiver are the same
- Clarifications specific to Assignment 2
  - The attacker is a single node
  - In case of more than one attacker nodes, they all will perform attack individually. They do *NOT* coordinate with
    each other and are unaware of the existence of other attackers
  - Each attacker assumes that all other people are honest (this assumption is not used by the attacker in any part of
    the attacking logic)
  - The attacker does not forward blocks generated/mined by other nodes

## Execution Steps and Images
